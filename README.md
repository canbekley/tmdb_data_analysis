# TMDb Data Analysis
This project is an end to end data analysis of a tmdb movie dataset containing over 10.000 movie entries that were released between 1960 and 2015.

## Prerequisite
### Files that are included:
<ul><li><code>report.html</code> - the complete data analysis report</li>
  <li><code>report_w_code.ipynb</code> - a JSON file, formatted for the usage in Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li><code>environment.yaml</code> - the environment containing the packages and their versions to be used with Anaconda</li>
  <li><code>requirements.txt</code> - all packages and their versions listed in a txt-file</li>
  <li><code>tmdb-movies.csv</code> - the original dataset file</li>
  <li><code>tmdb_movies_edited.csv</code> - the editied dataset file</li></ul>

### Installation:
In order to run the project on <code>Anaconda</code>, you will need to download the file: <code>report_w_code.ipynb</code>, <code>environment.yaml</code>, and <code>tmdb-movies.csv</code> and save them in the same directory. Next, you will have to navigate with the <code>Anaconda Prompt</code> to the directory of the files. Create the environment using <code>conda env create -f environment.yaml</code> and activate it with <code>activate py3</code>. Now you can open the notebook by typing in <code>Jupyter Notebook</code> and run the IPYNB file from there.

### Without Installation:
You can just view the complete analysis and the used code from the included HTML file <code>report.html</code> without any prerequisitions.
